ChatGPT walked me through each piece of code in a concise and straightfroward manner while still being able to encapsulate all the essentials. I returned from those virtual session with a greater clarity of both how the code worked as well as the underlying concepts. Via my expereicne with Chatbots and LLMs, I have realized that Chatbots seems to excel in areas involving code. In fact, I now rely on Github Copilot to code various projects and it does a very thorough and consistent job. One can perhaps say that coding is the task these LLMs are best at, perhaps due to the large swaths of open source code available for training."
